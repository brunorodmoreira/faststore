# Overview
</header>

Overriding components allows you to seamlessly replace native components with custom-built ones while retaining core functionalities. 
For example, you can replace native components like the shopping cart or alerts with tailored solutions specifically for your store.

In FastStore, all component customizations occur within sections, and you can create multiple overrides for native sections.
The process of overriding a component within a section returns a new React component, representing the overridden section.

  Sections are page components that wrap up other components, enabling you to create cohesive and functional content for your store. 
For example, the Hero section is a native section that includes the following components: `Hero`, `HeroImage`, and `HeroHeader`.

## Frequently asked questions

### Why are some components tagged as `__experimental`?

Some components are undergoing migration to FastStore UI. While they are not yet fully migrated, 
`__experimental` components exists.


### What types of components can be overridden within FastStore?

All overridable components are [FastStore UI](/components). This makes it easy to override and leverage existing props by passing them down.

### Which definitions take precedence when overriding props in FastStore, the custom ones or Headless CMS props?

Prop overrides change the default definitions for that prop. Headless CMS props will always win override or default prop definitions.

###  Is it possible to partially override components in FastStore?
For each component, one must override only props or the whole component, never both.

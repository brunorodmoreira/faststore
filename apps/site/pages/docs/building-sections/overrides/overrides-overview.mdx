# Overview
</header>

Overrides in FastStore allow you to replace native components such as alerts or shopping carts with custom ones within sections. This maintains the core functionalities of native components while adapting the appearance and behavior to suit your store.

In FastStore, all component customizations happen within sections. You can create multiple overrides for native sections, resulting in a new React component representing the overridden section.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Sections are native components that group other components to create one part of your store page, for example the [Hero](https://www.faststore.dev/components/organisms/hero) that includes the following components: `Hero`, `HeroImage`, and `HeroHeader`,
  simplifying the process of building cohesive layouts.

## Override options

There are three options to customize your component through overrides:

<Steps>
### Overriding component props
 
Change a component's behavior by [passing additional props](https://www.faststore.dev/docs/building-sections/overrides/override-component-props) to it in your store code.
 
### Overriding a section
 
[Build a new section](https://www.faststore.dev/docs/building-sections/overrides/override-component) based on its native equivalent to achieve the desired functionality.

### Overriding section styles
 
Customize the look and feel of a section without changing its functionality through its [styles](https://www.faststore.dev/docs/building-sections/overrides/override-section-styles).

</Steps>

## Available sections to override

Explore the available sections and their components in the [List of native sections](https://www.faststore.devhttp/docs/building-sections/overrides/list-of-native-sections) guide. 
Also, check out the sections equivalent [Headless CMS schemas](https://www.faststore.dev/docs/headless-cms-integration/3-adding-content-types-and-sections#step-2---adding-content-types-to-the-headless-cms). 

Once you define which section you can choose to override only the props or the whole section.

### `__experimental` components

Some sections contain components tagged with `__experimental`. This tag means that components are undergoing migration to [FastStore UI](https://www.faststore.dev/components) and might have limitations. 
While they are not yet fully migrated, `__experimental` components exist.

## Headless CMS customization and overrides

Keep in mind that customizations made directly in the VTEX Admin through the [Headless CMS](https://www.faststore.dev/docs/headless-cms-overview) take priority over code-based overrides.

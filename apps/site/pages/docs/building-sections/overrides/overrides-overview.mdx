All component customizations in FastStore are performed within a section. 
The process of overriding a component within a section returns a new React component, representing the overridden section. These components are no different from any other custom component in your store.
To override props, you need to choose the desired native section and component from the [List of available native sections](/docs/building-sections/list-of-native-sections#faststore-native-sections).

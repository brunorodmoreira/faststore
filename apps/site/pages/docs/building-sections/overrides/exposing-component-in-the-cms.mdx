# Sending components to the Headless CMS

During the override of [components](/) and [props components](/) one of the steps
is to make the overrided component available in the [Headless CMS]().

1. In the FastStore root directory, create a folder named `cms`.
2. Inside `cms`, create the `faststore` folder.
3. Within the `cms/faststore` folder, create `sections.json` file.
4. Add the schema of the new section, to the `sections.json` file. 
The schema defines how the Headless CMS renders the section.

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'
 
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  To structure the schema correctly refer to the [Step 3: Adding sections to the Headless CMS](/docs/headless-cms-integration/3-adding-content-types-and-sections#step-3-adding-sections-to-the-headless-cms). 
  Also, refer to the [List of Native Sections and Overridable Components](/docs/building-sections/overrides/list-of-native-sections) to check the schemas for each component.

5. Once you add the schema to the `sections.json` file, run the following command to send your changes to the Headless CMS:

```bash copy
faststore cms-sync
```
6. In the VTEX Admin, got to **Storefront > Headless CMS** and click on the page you desire to add the ne section.
7. Add the section and edit as you need.

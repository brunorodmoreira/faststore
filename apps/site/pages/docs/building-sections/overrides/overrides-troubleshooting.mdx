## My overrides don't show up
There are two possibilities for a override not showwing up in your store:

### 1. Import the `getOverriddenSection` functional
Make sure you have import the function from `@faststore/core` package into the custom component file.

### 2. Add the component to the Headless CMS:

Make sure you add the schema for the new section in the Headless CMS and replace the native section for your customized one.
Refer to the [Sending components to the Headless CMS](/docs/building-sections/overrides/sending-components-to-the-headless-cms) guide.


## My prop overrides don't work

Several sections have default prop definitions that, in the moment it is added to the Headless CMS, can bypass your prop overrides. Consider removing default values.

## My custom section class name don't work

Check if the className added to the section is the same declared in the stylesheet. For example, if in the section
you declared `className: styles.simpleAlert`, in the stylesheet you must declase `.simpleAlert`

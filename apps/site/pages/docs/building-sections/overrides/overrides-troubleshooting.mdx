## I can't display my overrides

### 1. Missing `getOverriddenSection` function

**Symptom:** Overrides fail to display in your store.

**Solution:** Ensure that you have imported the `getOverriddenSection` function from the `@faststore/core` package into your custom component file.

### 2. Component missing in the Headless CMS

**Symptom:** Overrides are not reflected in the Headless CMS.

**Solution:** Add the schema for the new section to the Headless CMS and replace the native section with your customized one. For detailed instructions, refer to the [Sending Components to the Headless CMS guide](/docs/building-sections/overrides/sending-components-to-the-headless-cms).

## I can't make the override's props function as expected

**Symptom:** Prop overrides are not behaving as you set.

**Solution:** Default prop definitions in some sections can override your custom props upon addition to the Headless CMS. Consider removing default values to ensure prop overrides work as intended.

## My overrides style is not displaying

**Symptom:** Custom section class names do not apply as expected.

**Solution:** Verify that the `className` added to the section matches the one declared in the stylesheet. For instance, if you declared `className: styles.simpleAlert` in the section, ensure that the corresponding style declaration in the stylesheet is `.simpleAlert`.

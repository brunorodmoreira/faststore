# Best practices for overrides

<Steps>

### Working with an experimental feature

Keep in mind that this is an experimental feature and may undergo updates that could render your current overrides as legacy code without ongoing support. To keep up with every change, check the [release notes](https://developers.vtex.com/updates/release-notes) for any updates.

### Considering the impact in the store performance

Using overrides does not significantly impact performance. FastStore's handling of props and design tokens is designed for good performance. However, your customizations may introduce additional work, so consider overall store performance by checking Lighthouse reports on GitHub logs and Pull Requests.

### Styling custom components

When styling custom components created for overrides, follow the guidelines provided in [Customizing a new component when using override](https://www.faststore.dev/docs/customizing/components#customizing-a-new-component-when-using-override). These guidelines will help you maintain consistency and ensure your custom components integrate seamlessly with the rest of the FastStore ecosystem.

## Override Native Component's Props

Overriding props allows you to customize a component's behavior while preserving its native integration. This approach is useful when you want to customize specific aspects of a native component, for example an icon or a button label. 

For this guide, we'll use the [`BuyButton`](/components/molecules/buy-button#props) component to make the customization. Before we dive in, it's worth mentioning that the `BuyButton` component plays a crucial role in facilitating...

Here's how the initial component looks with the `size` prop set as `regular` in the PDP (Product Details Page):

### Step by step

#### Step 1 - Setting up the component file

1. After choosing a native section to be customized from the [list of available native sections](/docs/building-sections/list-of-native-sections), open your FastStore project in any code editor of your preference.
2. Go to the `src` folder, create the `components` folder and inside it, create the `sections` folder. 

The naming of the folders is arbitrary, as overrides can be created in any file. You can run the following command to create them:


<Tabs items={['macOS and Linux', 'Windows']}>
  <Tab>```bash copy mkdir src/components src/components/sections ```</Tab>
  <Tab>```bash copy mkdir src\components src\components\sections ```</Tab>
</Tabs>

3. In the `sections` folder, create a new file for your customized section. For example, create a new file named `ProductDetailsWithCustomButton.tsx` under the `src/components/sections` directory.

<Tabs items={['macOS and Linux', 'Windows']}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy touch src/components/sections/ProductDetailsWithCustomButton.tsx ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy type nul > src\components\sections\ProductDetailsWithCustomButton.tsx
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

4. Copy and paste the following code snippet into the file:

```tsx filename="ProductDetailsWithCustomButton.tsx" copy
import { ProductDetailsSection, getOverriddenSection } from '@faststore/core'

const ProductDetailsWithCustomButton = getOverriddenSection({
  Section: ProductDetailsSection,
  components: {},
})

export { ProductDetailsWithCustomButton }
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Change the value of the `Section` variable to the section you want to
  override. In the given example, we set the `Section` variable to the component
  `ProductDetailsSection` to override this specific section.
</Callout>

5. Save your changes.

#### Step 2 - Setting up the override

1. Open the `ProductDetailsWithCustomButton.tsx` file created in the [Step 1 - Setting up the component file](#step-1-setting-up-the-overrides-folder) and add the following code:

```tsx filename="ProductDetailsWithCustomButton.tsx" {8-9}
import { ProductDetailsSection, getOverriddenSection } from '@faststore/core'

const ProductDetailsWithCustomButton = getOverriddenSection({
  Section: ProductDetailsSection,
  components: {
    BuyButton: { props: { size: 'small', iconPosition: 'right' } },
  },
})

export { ProductDetailsWithCustomButton }
```

This code overrides the `BuyButton` props `size` and `iconPosition`. You'll see a smaller button than the initial one, and the cart icon positioned on the right side.

#### Step 3 - Adding the component to the CMS


1. In the FastStore root directory, create a folder named `cms`.
2. Inside `cms`, create the `faststore` folder.
3. Within the `cms/faststore` folder, create `sections.json` file.
4. In the `sections.json` file add the new section that you want to display in the Headless CMS. The schema below defines how the Headless CMS renders a section:

```json filename="sections.json" copy
  [
    {
      
    }
  ]
```

#### Step 4 - Replacing this component on the page

REMOVE EXISTING PRODUCT DETAILS
ADD NEW ProductDetailsWithCustomButton TO THE PAGE

### Step 5 - Visualizing the component on the page

1. Run `yarn dev` in the terminal to start the development server. Access the CMS preview in your browser and go to product details page to see the updated `BuyButton` component:

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Remember: props changed via Headless CMS overlap the changes made through
  [override](/docs/building-sections/overriding-components-and-props#override-native-components-props).
  For example, if you change a prop through override and also change it using
  Headless CMS, the final prop's value will be the one added using CMS.
